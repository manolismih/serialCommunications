## Project description
Implementation of a Java application that connects with a remote server and communicates with it via asynchrounous serial communication methods, emulated by a virtual modem class. The required [userApplication](userApplication.java) functions are:
* Estimating the response time (ping) of the server.
* Implementing an ARQ mechanism for error checking and reliable data trasnfer.
* Estimating the BER (bit error rate) and the delay caused by artificial noise.
* Receiving an error-free and an error-prone bitmap image.
* Receiving GPS tracks and plotting them on google maps.

In addition, some statistics analyseis are required (done in SPSS) for generating plots and estimations for 2 different time sessions.
